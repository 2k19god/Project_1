 	<font color = "white"><p>A binary means that something has “two states”. An example of a binary device is a on and off light switch. The reason why an on and off light switch is a binary device is because it has exactly two stats, on and off. Binary devices has advantages. They are that binary devices are simple and easy to build, flawless copies can be made, anything can be represented with bits, and binary devices have unambiguous signals.</p>

 	<font color = "white"><p>I now know that Analog Signals can continuously change in value. Even though they change in value, the exact value at any time is important. Binary signals are easy to read and tell what's going on. Also, the threshold is a line on the graph that separates the lower half which means off and the higher half which means on. This means that if the line is above the threshold, its on and if it’s lower, it’s off.</p>

 	<br>
 	<img src="">
 	<p>A computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that is used for entering data into, and displaying or printing data from, a computer or a computing system. The’re many types of terminals. Terminals often consist of just a keyboard and monitor, with a connection to another computer. The purpose of a terminal is not to process information, but to send commands to another system. With modern computers, the word "terminal" usually refers to a terminal program, or emulator, which provides a text-based interface for typing commands.</p>

 	<p>A programmer is a person that create things, develop logic, analyze problems, find a solution. Basically they are problems solvers, however, they make crafty solutions. They use Terminal witch is where you put in inputs and receive outputs. The terminal holds the shell which interprets a command and gives you an output.</p>

Learning the File System</font>
 	<br>
 	<img src="">
 	<p>A file is an object on a computer that stores data, information, settings, or commands used with a computer program. Some types of files are text files, image files, and internet files. You can tell what file you’re looking at with the file extension. Some examples of file extensions are .text which is a text file and .Jpeg which is a image file.</p>
